Title: Built a production-ready GenAI chatbot platform with AWS Bedrock - Here's my experience

Just finished deploying a comprehensive chatbot platform using AWS Bedrock that integrates multiple AI models (Claude 3, Llama 3, AI21) with domain-specific expertise.

Key learnings:
• Bedrock's multi-model approach is game-changing for cost optimization
• Serverless architecture scales beautifully with zero server management
• Smart model routing can save 40-60% on AI costs
• Documentation is crucial for production deployment

Architecture: Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB + CloudFront
Frontend: React with responsive design
Security: CORS, input validation, rate limiting

Live demo: [URL]
Open source: [GitHub URL]

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Title: Built a React frontend for AWS Bedrock chatbot - Performance and UX insights

Just shipped a React app that interfaces with AWS Bedrock AI models. Some interesting challenges and solutions:

• Real-time chat UX with conversation history
• Dynamic model/domain switching without page reload
• Responsive design that works on mobile
• Error handling for AI service timeouts
• Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance

Tech stack: React 18, CSS Grid/Flexbox, Axios, React Router
Deployment: S3 + CloudFront for global CDN

The app handles 5 different AI conversation domains with seamless switching. Performance is solid with 1-8s response times depending on AI model complexity.

Code is open source: [GitHub URL]
Live demo: [URL]

Would love feedback on the UX patterns!
